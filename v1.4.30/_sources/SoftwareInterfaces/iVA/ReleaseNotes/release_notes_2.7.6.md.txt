# Vision Assistant 2.7.6

### Added
- Motion Camera Calibration wizard. It is available as an application.
### Changed
- The ODS occupancy grid is displayed as a binary white/black instead of grayscale. The threshold is set at 127 by default: grid cells with a probability above 127 will be colored white, the others black. The right-hand side detailed view still shows the grayscale (this tab needs to be expanded by clicking on the two arrows on the right edge of the window).
### Fixed
- Ports can now be smoothly added and removed in the application configuration.     
- The ports can be properly switched on/off in the "View options" in "Replay" mode.
- The VPU temperature display is no longer obstructed by long port names.
### Known issues
- Importing settings from file with the "Save and Reboot" enabled triggers error messages.
