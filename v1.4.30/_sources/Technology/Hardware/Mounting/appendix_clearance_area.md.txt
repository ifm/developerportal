# Appendix to the clearance area documentation: illumination profiles

The clearance area for both camera is defined by the beam profiles of the illumination modules on the horizontal and vertical axis, meaning in how wide of an area light is emitted by the VCSELs.

For the O3R225, the beam profile is displayed below:

For the O3R222, the beam profile is displayed below:

For each axis, we consider the angle at which only 2% or less of the maximum light intensity remains.
This means that at around +/- 80 degrees, the amount of light remaining is sufficiently low not to cause unwanted interference when reflected over close-by surfaces.
