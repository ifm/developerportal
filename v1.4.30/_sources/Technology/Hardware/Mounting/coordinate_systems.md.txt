# Coordinate systems

The origin of the coordinate system of the camera head is at the center of the four mounting screws on the backplate. The default orientation of the coordinate system is such that Z points forward in the viewing direction of the camera, Y points in the opposite direction from the label and X points in the direction of the cables entry.

See the figure below:

The origin of the coordinate system of the OVP8xx VPU is at the center of the four rear mounting screws. The orientation is such that Z points up, Y points in the direction of the cables entry, and X points to the right.
