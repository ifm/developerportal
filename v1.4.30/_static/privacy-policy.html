<p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> &nbsp;Cookies</em></p>

<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the previously mentioned data cookies are stored on your PC when you use our websites. Cookies are small text files which are stored on your hard disk assigned to the browser you use and by means of which the person setting the cookie (here: we) receives certain information. Cookies cannot execute any programs or transfer viruses to your computer. Their purpose is to make the websites more user-friendly and effective. The basis is your explicit consent you give when you start visiting our website and which can be revoked at any time pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (a) GDPR or Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (f) GDPR.</p>

<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These websites use the following types of cookies the scope and function of which are explained below:</p>

<ul>
 <li>transient cookies (see aa)</li>
 <li>persistent cookies (see bb).</li>
</ul>

<p>aa)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Transient cookies are automatically deleted when you close the browser. These include in particular session cookies. They store a session ID by means of which several requests from your browser can be assigned to one and the same session. This allows your computer to be recognised when you return to our websites. The session cookies are deleted when you log out or close the browser.</p>

<p>bb)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a time defined by us. This time may vary according to the cookies. You can delete the cookies in the security settings of your browser at any time. With this deletion you also withdraw your consent to process the respective cookie.</p>

<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can configure your browser settings according to your wishes and for example reject the acceptance of third-party cookies or all cookies. Please note, that in such a case you may not be able to use all functions of our websites.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">If you leave the "Keep me logged in" function enabled when logging in to "my ifm", a permanent cookie (for 60 days) is set in the browser of your end device. This ensures that the website recognises you next time you visit. You can delete this cookie via your browser settings at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data collection through Google Analytics</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Ltd. ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Analytics uses "cookies", text files stored on your computer making it possible to analyse the way you use the website. As a rule, the information about your use of this website generated by means of cookies is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">If IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address is shortened beforehand by Google in countries in the European Union and other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Please note that this website uses Google Analytics with the code extension "anonymizelp" to ensure an anonymised version of the IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">On behalf of the website owner, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, create reports about website activities and provide further services related to web site and internet use to the website owner. The IP address transferred by your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other Google data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">The basis for the processing of data is your consent in accordance with point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. You may withdraw your consent with effect for the future at any time by making the appropriate setting in our <a href="#" onclick="UC_UI.showSecondLayer()">cookie consent tool</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Google processes your personal data to some extent in the USA. Currently, no adequacy decision by the EU Commission exists for a data transfer. The adequate level of data protection is therefore ensured through the use of EU standard contractual clauses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">You can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser settings accordingly; however, we point out that if you do so, you might not be able to use all functions of this website.</p>

<p>2.5 Google Tag Manager</p>

<p>This website uses Google Tag Manager. This service makes it possible to manage website tags via a surface. Google Tag Manager only implements tags. This means: No cookies are used, and no personal data is collected. Google Tag Manager activates other tags that might collect data. However, Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If you have selected deactivation at domain or cookie level, it will remain valid for all tracking tags, provided that they have been implemented with Google Tag Manager.</p>

<p>2.6 DoubleClick</p>

<p>This website uses DoubleClick. Using the Google service DoubleClick enables us to provide the user with relevant advertisements. For this purpose, cookies are used that can identify the user's browser. This makes it possible to trace back which advertisements were shown and which of them the user has clicked on.</p>

<p>2.7 Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</p>

<p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising service offered by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).</p>

<p>Within the scope of Google AdWords, we use a service called conversion tracking. If you click on an ad delivered by Google, a cookie will be set to enable conversion tracking. Cookies are small text files that the internet browser stores on the user's computer. These cookies will expire after 30 days and are not used to identify the user. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we will be able to tell that the user has clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>

<p>Every Google AdWords client gets a different cookie. The cookies cannot be traced back via the websites of AdWords clients. The information collected by using the conversion cookie is used to prepare conversion statistics for AdWords clients who have decided in favour of conversion tracking. The clients are informed about the overall number of users that have clicked on their ad and proceeded to a page that has a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that would make it possible to personally identify the user. If you do not wish to be tracked, you can object to this service by deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie in the user settings of your internet browser. In this case, you will not be considered in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>

<p>Conversion cookies are stored on the basis of section 1 of article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation. The website owner has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise the website and advertising.</p>

<p>You will find more information about Google AdWords and Google conversion tracking in Google's data protection regulation: <a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>You can set your browser to receive a notification if a cookie is set and only accept cookies in individual cases, prevent them in specific cases or in general and activate automatic deletion of cookies when the browser is closed. Deactivating cookies may restrict the functionality of this website.</p>

<p>2.8 Google Analytics Remarketing</p>

<p>Our websites use the function of Google Analytics Remarketing in connection with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>

<p>This function makes it possible to link the advertisement target groups that are created with Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This makes it possible that interest-related, personalised advertising messages that were adjusted to you on the basis of your past user and browsing behaviour on an end device (e.g. mobile phone) will also be displayed on another of your end devices (e.g. tablet or PC).</p>

<p>If you have given corresponding consent, Google will link your web and app browser history to your Google account. Thereby the same personalised advertising messages can be provided on every end device where you log into your Google account.</p>

<p>To support this function, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated user IDs that will be temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data in order to define or create target groups for cross-device advertising.</p>

<p>You can permanently object to cross-device remarketing/targeting by deactivating personalised advertising in your Google account. For this purpose, just follow this link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>

<p>The data collected will only be linked to your Google account on the basis of your consent given to Google, which you can revoke (Section 1 of Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation). In case of data collection processes that will not be linked to your Google account (e.g. because you do not have a Google account or because you have objected to the linking), the data collection is based on Section 1 of Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation. The legitimate interest is a result of the fact that the website owner has an interest in an anonymised analysis of the website visitors for advertising purposes.</p>

<p>You will find more information and the data protection regulations in Google's privacy note: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a>.</p>

<p>2.9 Facebook Website Custom Audiences</p>

<p>For our website, we use the "website custom audiences" pixel of the Facebook social network, <a href="x-apple-data-detectors://36">1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA</a>. As a result, so-called tracking pixels are integrated into our pages. When you visit our pages, the tracking pixel will create a direct link between your browser and the Facebook server. Thus, Facebook will receive the information from your browser that our website was accessed from your device. If you are a Facebook user, Facebook can therefore associate your visit to our pages with your user account. Please note that we as the provider of this website are not notified of the content of the data transmitted or of the use thereof by Facebook. We can merely&nbsp;specify the segments of Facebook users (based on criteria such as age, interests) on whose pages we would like our ads to be displayed.&nbsp; We use one of the two Custom Audiences processes without any data records being transmitted to Facebook, especially no email addresses of our users - neither coded nor uncoded. For more&nbsp;information concerning this topic, please see Facebook’s privacy policy at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to object to the use of Facebook Website Custom Audiences, please go to <a href="http://www.nestle.de/info/rechtshinweise#showDisclaimer=1%26idDisclaimer=Facebook4%26versionDisclaimer=0" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences/</a>.</p>

<p>Conversion analysis using the Facebook conversion pixel<br>
We use the conversion pixel or visitor action pixel of Facebook Inc.,&nbsp;<a href="x-apple-data-detectors://39">1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA</a>(“Facebook”). This pixel allows Facebook to see whether a Facebook advertisement has been successful, e.g. has led to an online transaction. For this purpose, Facebook gives us statistical data only, without reference to a specific person. This allows us to analyse the efficiency of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes. Especially if you have a Facebook account, we refer you to their privacy policy at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>Please go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>, if you want to withdraw your consent to the use of the conversion pixel.</p>

<p>2.10 Google Optimize</p>

<p>Our website uses the web analysis and optimisation service “Google Optimize”, which is provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter “Google Optimize”). We use the Google Optimize service to increase the attractiveness, content and functionality of our website by playing new functions and content to a percentage of our users and statistically evaluating the change in usage. Google Optimize is a sub-service of Google Analytics (see section Google Analytics).</p>

<p>Google Optimize uses cookies to optimise and analyse your use of our website. As a rule, the information about your use of our website generated by means of these cookies is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We use Google Optimize with IP anonymisation activated so that your IP address is shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website optimisation tests and related website activity, and providing other services to us relating to website activity and internet usage.</p>

<p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your internet browser accordingly. Besides, you can prevent the transmission of data about your use of our website generated by cookies (incl. your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading the browser plugin available at: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.
