# Minimum Amplitude
## Abstract

The `Minimum amplitude` (`diParam.minAmplitude`) parameter invalidates pixels where the amplitude (reflected light) drops below the minimum threshold.

## Description

For each pixel, the amplitude value represents how much light was received by the imager. The `minimum amplitude` parameter provides a threshold that defines when the system should discard low amplitude pixels. The images below show the amplitude image and the point cloud for a scene containing black totes, which are made out of a dark plastic and reflect very little light. Part of the point cloud is missing where the amplitude is below the threshold.

|--|--|

Now, letâ€™s see what happens when we change this threshold value. In the table below, we display the same scene measured with different amplitude thresholds. With a value of zero, we can compute the point cloud for the very dark areas. When we increase the threshold to 50, a large part of the point cloud is lost.

|Minimum amplitude| Point cloud|
|:-:|-|
|0|![min-a,p-0-3d](./resources/amp_0_3D.png "3D point cloud with minimum amplitude 0 values")|
|20|![min-a,p-0-3d](./resources/default_value_3D.png "3D point cloud with minimum amplitude 0 values")|
|50|![min-a,p-0-3d](./resources/amp_50_3D.png "3D point cloud with minimum amplitude 0 values")|

In certain cases, such as when black objects are in the field-of-view, changing the default value from 20 to zero can be beneficial because more pixels are valid, leading to a more complete point cloud. Generally speaking, lowering the amplitude leads to more ambient noise and less accuracy in the distance measurement. In this case, we encourage you to test the [filters](../parameters.md) available with the O3R to mitigate the noise from black objects measurements.

> Note: black objects in the visible spectrum are not necessarily black in the near infrared range.

> Note: The minimum amplitude threshold is applied to the *non-normalized* amplitude image. The numerical value of the *normalized* amplitude image might not correspond to expected values with the set threshold. The normalization factor used in our algorithm is accessible as part of the PCIC output and called `ampNormalizationFactor`.

The minimum amplitude parameter is related to the maximum distance noise parameter: a low amplitude value with a high distance noise value ensures that more pixels are valid but will allow for a noisier measurement, requiring some filtering, for instance with the temporal filter. See the following:
