# Useful sphinx-doc stuff:

## Create a "news" banner
Copy/paste this html snippet and replace with your text.

```html
<div class = "news-banner">
<p class = "news-banner-title">News: </p>
<p class = "news-banner-content"> This is a news banner. </p>
</div>
```

If you want to change the color of the background, you can use the background color tag:
<div class = "news-banner">
<p class = "news-banner-title" background-color = yellow>News: </p>
<p class = "news-banner-content"> This is a news banner. </p>
</div>
