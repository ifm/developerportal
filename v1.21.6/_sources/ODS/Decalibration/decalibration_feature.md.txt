# Camera decalibration detection

:::{note}
    This feature is available only from the firmwares >= 1.20.29
:::

The main purpose of this feature is to detect if the camera is decalibrated by comparing the current estimated extrinsic calibration with the user-provided extrinsic calibration. The feature focuses specifically on detecting deviations in the rotation of the camera. The translation is not considered.

When decalibration is detected, the system generates an `ERROR_ODSAPP_CAMERA_DECALIBRATED` diagnostic message. This diagnostic is mapped to the corresponding port: the source is `/applications/instances/app<X>/ports/port<x>` where `app<x>` represents the specific ODS application instance and `port<x>` represents the decalibrated port.

As this is a diagnostic with severity `minor`, the vehicle doesn't have to be stopped immediately, but calibration values should be reviewed while the vehicle is stationary for example during charging.

:::{important}

- The camera must be properly calibrated using one of the calibration routines described in the [Calibration Routines section](../../CalibrationRoutines/index_calibrations.md).
- If the initial calibration is significantly wrongâ€”such as being completely misaligned or having incorrect extrinsic translation parameters, the algorithm may not be able to detect decalibration properly and may not trigger the diagnostic alert.

## What to do when decalibration is detected

If the ODS application has flagged a `ERROR_ODSAPP_CAMERA_DECALIBRATED` diagnostic message, follow the steps below to determine whether a manual recalibration is needed or if valid correction data is already available.

1. Inspect the `rotDeltaValid` array:
   1. The elements of this array correspond to the rotations around X, Y and Z respectively.
   2. A value of 1 indicates a valid estimation; 0 means the system couldn't determine a reliable correction for the respective axis.
2. If all the validity flags show the value 1, review the correction values:
   1. If the corrected calibration values appear to be suspicious, compare the estimated calibration against the original CAD reference values. Accumulated small calibration adjustments can result in a substantial overall deviation from the intended configuration. 
   2. The direct comparison of rot[XYZ] values may be misleading, it is advisable to compare human-readable angles (e.g., yaw, pitch, roll) or the corresponding rotation matrices to assess the consistency of the calibration.
3. If the corrected values are reasonable, apply them:
   1. Use the fully corrected values (`rotHeadToUser`) to update your camera's extrinsic calibration parameters.
4. Re-calibrate if necessary: if one or more validity flags show 0 or the correction values seem unusually large, consider performing a full manual recalibration.

For a typical calibration correction sequence, view the flowchart below.

## Extrinsic calibration correction

The estimated extrinsic calibration values are provided by algorithm and can be retrieved by deserializing the buffer_id `O3R_ODS_EXTRINSIC_CALIBRATION_CORRECTION` which has the following structure.

| `completionRate` | `float32`    | Represents the completion rate of data collection, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 1.0 signifies that sufficient data has been gathered to estimate all three rotational delta values. |
