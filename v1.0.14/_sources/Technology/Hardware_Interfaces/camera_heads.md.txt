## Operational conditions

The `O3R2xx` camera heads are `IP54` rated, which means that with regular maintenance and cleaning, they can be used in some harsher environments, such as dusty conditions and mixed indoor/outdoor conditions. In all operating conditions, the cameras must be cleaned regularly to prevent dust or particles from building up on the surface of the camera head, which will gradually degrade the camera's measurement performance (review the [cleaning instructions below](#cleaning-camera-heads)).

Please note that all O3R camera heads (O3R222 and O3R225) are designed for indoor use. Outdoor conditions may work depending on the application requirements but must be benchmarked by the customer.

Mixed indoor - outdoor conditions are understood by ifm to be conditions that are mainly indoors but may include bright illumination patterns of overhead skylights and windows on the floor and objects.

## Cleaning camera heads

It is important to clean the camera heads regularly because any dirt, dust, or fingerprints on the lens or front of the camera housing can interfere with the accuracy of the camera's measurements. The camera heads work by emitting a light signal and measuring the time it takes for the signal to reflect back to the sensor. If there is dirt or dust on the lens or illumination module, it can scatter the light signal and cause inaccuracies in the measurements. This can impact the performance of any systems that rely on that data, such as ODS.

Regular cleaning can help to ensure that they are operating at their best performance and producing accurate and reliable data. The best practices to clean the cameras are as follows:
- Use a clean, lint-free cloth: When cleaning the camera, it is important to use a clean, lint-free cloth that will not scratch or damage the lens or sensor. Microfiber cloth is a good choice.
- Use compressed air or a blower brush to gently blow away any debris from the lens and sensor.
- Avoid using water or harsh chemicals as this can damage the lens or sensor.
- Clean regularly: To maintain optimal performance, it is recommended to clean the camera heads regularly. It is advised to clean the cameras heads at least once per week. Depending on the environment shorter cleaning intervals may be required. We recommend to implement a weekly cleaning maintenance for non-dusty environments. For dusty environments a daily cleaning maintenance schedule is advised.

## Use-cases
Different camera heads are available for the O3R platform and they are best suited for different use cases:
- The O3R222 has a narrow field of view which is ideal for applications focussing on detecting smaller objects, edges and objects at longer ranges.
- The O3R225 camera head has a wider field of view which is ideal for the applications focussing on perceiving the larger areas and minimizing dead zones.
