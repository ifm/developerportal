# Diagnostic

Before testing the ODS application it is advised to see the diagnostics window. In ifmVisionAssistant one can see the diagnostics by clicking on `Device Status` at the top right corner of the window. In the diagnostics window, check for active errors and please refer to the [respective diagnosis error codes](../../SoftwareInterfaces/ifmDiagnostic/index_diagnostic.md) and fix them.
