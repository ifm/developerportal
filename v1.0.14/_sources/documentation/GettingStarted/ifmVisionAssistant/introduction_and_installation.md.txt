# Introduction to the ifmVisionAssistant

The `ifmVisionAssistant` is a software tool provided by ifm for ifm vision products. It is used as a first configuration and debugging tool. Besides showing the received data, it is also possible to change parameters and showcase the capability of the O3R system (also containing applications e.g. ODS - Obstacle Detection System), and record data.

## Installing the ifmVisionAssistant

The ifmVisionAssistant does not need a local installation. It is provided with all needed shared libraries etc. to be run locally and without additional permission (admin) rights.

**Be advised, that the PC and the O3R system need to communicate via TCP/IP. To change certain IP settings, specific permissions are mandatory and might only be granted by the respective IT department.**
