# Hardware unboxing

If nobody tampered with your O3R package, you should have following hardware:
- Camera head (two of them if you ordered the developer kit)
![HEAD](./resources/head.jpg "O3R - HEAD")
- VPU (Video Processing Unit)  
![VPU](./resources/vpu.jpg "O3R - VPU")
- FPD cables to connect the head(s) to the VPU


You need a strong enough power source: 2.5A and 24V minimum.

1) First, connect the head(s) to the VPU; the only requirement is to connect pairs of same imager types together, for instance as shown below:  
![CONNECTION-OVERVIEW](./resources/connection_overview.png "Connections")  
2) Connect power to the VPU - <font color=red>ATTENTION: PIN2 is power! PIN3 is ground</font>   
3) Connect the ethernet cable (not included in the package)  
4) Wait until you see the ethernet LED flashing before pinging/connecting to the VPU.  

That's it about the hardware.
