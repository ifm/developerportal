<p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> &nbsp;Cookies</em></p>

<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the previously mentioned data cookies are stored on your PC when you use our websites. Cookies are small text files which are stored on your hard disk assigned to the browser you use and by means of which the person setting the cookie (here: we) receives certain information. Cookies cannot execute any programs or transfer viruses to your computer. Their purpose is to make the websites more user-friendly and effective. The basis is your explicit consent you give when you start visiting our website and which can be revoked at any time pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (a) GDPR or Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (f) GDPR.</p>

<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These websites use the following types of cookies the scope and function of which are explained below:</p>

<ul>
<li>transient cookies (see aa)</li>
<li>persistent cookies (see bb).</li>
</ul>

<p>aa)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Transient cookies are automatically deleted when you close the browser. These include in particular session cookies. They store a session ID by means of which several requests from your browser can be assigned to one and the same session. This allows your computer to be recognised when you return to our websites. The session cookies are deleted when you log out or close the browser.</p>

<p>bb)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a time defined by us. This time may vary according to the cookies. You can delete the cookies in the security settings of your browser at any time. With this deletion you also withdraw your consent to process the respective cookie.</p>

<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can configure your browser settings according to your wishes and for example reject the acceptance of third-party cookies or all cookies. Please note, that in such a case you may not be able to use all functions of our websites.</p>

<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Google Analytics</em></p>

<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; These websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google").&nbsp; Google Analytics uses "cookies", text files stored on your computer making it possible to analyse the way you use the websites. As a rule, the information about your use of these websites generated by means of cookies is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymisation is activated on these websites, your IP address is shortened beforehand by Google in countries in the European Union or other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the website owner, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the websites, create reports about website activities and provide further services related to website and internet use to the website owner.</p>

<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The IP address transferred by your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other Google data.</p>

<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser settings accordingly; however, we point out that if you do so, you might not be able to use all functions of these websites. Furthermore, you can prevent the recording of data about your use of the websites generated by the cookie (incl. your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at:<br>
<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>

<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These websites use Google Analytics with the extension "_anonymizeIp()". IP addresses are then processed in a shortened form; reference to a person can thus be excluded. If a reference to a person is possible by means of the data collected for you, this reference is excluded at once and the personal data is deleted immediately.</p>

<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our websites to be able to improve them regularly. By means of the statistics we can improve our websites and make them more interesting for you, the user. For exceptional cases in which personal data is transmitted to the USA, Google has committed to adhering to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.
