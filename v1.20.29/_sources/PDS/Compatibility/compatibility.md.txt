# Camera and platform compatibility

The PDS application license is available in OVP812 and OVP813. For one PDS application instance only one 3D camera stream can be used at a time.

We recommend to use the O3R222 camera, as it provides the best performance. 

:::{important}
   VGA camera head(**O3R252**) is not supported by PDS application.
