# The checkerboard calibration target

Both calibration routines provided by ifm, the static camera calibration (SCC) and the motion camera calibration (MCC), use the same calibration target.

You can download the checkerboard in PDF format {download}` here <resources/checkerboardCalibrationTarget_600X800.pdf>`.

## Printing instructions

The checkerboard should be printed at scale, such that the printed size is:
- A page of 600 x 800 mm,
- The black and white squares are 10 cm each,
- The white border is 5 cm,
- The larger black square is 15 x 15 cm.

The checkerboard should be printed on:
- A rigid board, so that it will not bend when used,
- Matte paper, such that reflections from the camera are minimized.
