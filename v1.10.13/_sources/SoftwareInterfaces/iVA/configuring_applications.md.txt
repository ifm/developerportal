# Configuring/Activating an application

Depending on the purchased O3R hardware and license, different ifm applications (software solutions) are available and can be configured/inspected with the ifmVisionAssistant.

**Note: Not every hardware can configure every application.**

## Activating an application

The `Application` menu switches the ifmVisionAssistant to the application screen.

The application screen provides the possibility to activate/configure the available applications. It also displays 2D / 3D / `Occupancy grid`, etc, or other application specific data.
