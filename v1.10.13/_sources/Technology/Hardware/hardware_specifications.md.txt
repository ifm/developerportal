:::{Note}
To connect the drag chain cables to the VPU, you will need the connection cable [E3R106](https://www.ifm.com/de/en/product/E3R106). This cable assembly consists of:

1. **Two identical cables**: These connect the two drag chain cables to two VPU ports.
2. **One Y connector**: This combines the two ends of the drag chain cables into a single dual Fakra connector, which will be connected to the camera head.
