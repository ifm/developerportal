# Examples 

We provide a set of examples in Python and c++, using the ifm3d library, that show how to use the OVP8XX with the O3R2XX cameras in a variety of situations.

For convenience, all the examples are available as a standalone repository on GitHub. You can clone it with:

```bash
$ git clone --branch v1.0.0 https://github.com/ifm/ifm3d-examples.git
```

:::{note}
The examples are versioned along with the supported versions of the API and the firmware. 
Refer to [the compatibility matrix](https://github.com/ifm/ifm3d-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility) to find which tag is the one you should use.
:::

Follow the instructions in the example repository to build and run the examples.
